DMA
Peripheral-to-memory: a peripheral signals the DMA when it has received data. The DMA reads this data from the
peripheralâ€™s data FIFO, and writes it to an array in RAM

Transfersize 32, 16, 8 bit

READ_ADDR is a pointer to the next address to be read from. If the address does not increment (e.g. it is the address of a peripheral FIFO), and the next transfer sequence is
to/from that same address, there is no need to write to the register again.

CTRL.TREQ_SEL  select a peripheral data request (DREQ)

DREQ_ADC - DREQ channel for ADC


ADC_BASE 0x4004c000
ADC_FIFO = ADC_BASE + 0x0c;

To enable ADC DMA operations ADC needs to operate in FIFO mode
- adc_fifo_setup


__not_in_flash_func(x) allows function to be placed in SRAM rather in Flash memory
